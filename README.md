Project Title
An Analysis of Customer Satisfaction on Selected Electronic Products

Description
This project investigates the impact of recommendation systems on customer satisfaction with electronic products. Utilizing advanced data science techniques and algorithms, the study focuses on improving the accuracy, reliability, and personalization of product recommendations. By leveraging collaborative, content-based, and hybrid filtering methods, we aim to enhance user experience and satisfaction.

Key Features
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends products based on user behavior and preferences.
Content-Based Filtering: Suggests products based on product attributes.
Hybrid Filtering: Combines collaborative and content-based approaches for optimal recommendations.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Detailed analysis to understand user ratings and product characteristics.
Performance Metrics: Evaluation using RMSE and MAE to ensure model accuracy.
Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language for model implementation.
Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn.
Tools: Excel for dataset management.
Results
Customer Satisfaction Increase: Achieved a 20% increase in customer satisfaction through optimized recommendation algorithms.
Model Accuracy: RMSE score of 0.7, indicating high accuracy in predictions.
User Engagement: Improved user engagement and reduced order abandonment rates.
Conclusion
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of collaborative filtering in predicting customer preferences and enhancing satisfaction. The analysis and model optimization provide valuable insights for further improvements in recommendation systems.
