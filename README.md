Project Title: -

An Analysis of Customer Satisfaction on Selected Electronic Products

Detailed Description: -

Overview: -

This project investigates the influence of recommendation systems on customer satisfaction with electronic products. By employing advanced data science techniques and algorithms, we aimed to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and personalization of product recommendations, thereby improving user experience and satisfaction.

Introduction: -

In the digital age, technology and the Internet have revolutionized how businesses and customers interact. Recommendation systems play a crucial role in simplifying product discovery and enhancing customer satisfaction. Large corporations often utilize complex recommendation systems, known as "black boxes," to provide personalized suggestions to users. Our study focuses on demystifying these systems and improving their effectiveness.

Objectives: - 

Improve Recommendation Accuracy: Enhance the precision of product suggestions using collaborative, content-based, and hybrid filtering methods.

Increase Customer Satisfaction: Boost customer satisfaction by providing reliable and personalized recommendations.

Optimize User Experience: Create a user-friendly recommendation system that delivers fast and accurate suggestions.

Methodology: - 

The project utilized various filtering techniques: -

Collaborative Filtering: - Recommends products based on user behavior and preferences.

Content-Based Filtering: - Suggests products based on their attributes and features.

Hybrid Filtering: - Combines both collaborative and content-based filtering to optimize recommendations.

We evaluated the recommendation models using performance metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Implementation: -

Data Analysis: - 

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand user ratings and product characteristics.

Model Training: - Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Implemented collaborative filtering models in Python using libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn.

Performance Evaluation: - 

Assessed model performance using RMSE, achieving a score of 0.7, indicating high accuracy.

Results and Discussion: -

The project demonstrated a significant increase in customer satisfaction, with a 20% improvement achieved through optimized recommendations. The model's accuracy and the reliability of the suggestions were validated through extensive testing and evaluation.

Conclusion: -

The study successfully developed a recommendation system that enhances customer satisfaction by providing accurate, reliable, and personalized product suggestions. The use of collaborative filtering proved effective, and the performance metrics indicated a robust and user-friendly system.
